# Autolab Flask Test

For this challenge, you need to develop an API with Flask and send the code (with your .git folder) as a zip file.

We will assess the following

1. Coding standards
2. Best practices
3. Authenticity
4. Complexity (optimal code)
5. Effective use of data structures
6. Re-useability of code
7. Innovation

## Challenge

You are tasked to develop an api with:

-   one endpoint, /pokemon
-   Allow one endpoint to be filtered and sorted with parameters
-   Develop a Python script to import the data into a (SQLite) database.
-   Add authentication (any)
-   Some form of simple test

### Notes
- Any library (next to flask) is allowed .
- keep it simple.
- Make sure your code is clean.
- Make sure you include your git history in the zip file (.git folder).
- You should use Flask and Python (Important!)
- Please write the instructions to run your solution
